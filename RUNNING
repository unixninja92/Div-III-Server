Ensure that your environment is configured for running golang programs. See
http://golang.org/doc/code.html for details, but you should have something
similar to the following setup:

  export GOPATH=$HOME/go
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

Adjust these path locations to fit your Go environment.

To run the server:

  $GOPATH/bin/server
